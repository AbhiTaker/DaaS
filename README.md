# DaaS (Docker as a Service)

Our hack, DaaS (Docker as a Service) aims to provide easy computation and storage solutions on a local network. Each user can register and setup multiple containers, based on various images with an easy to use CLI. 

## Our API:

* User can choose from a range of available container configurations, with different OSâ€™s and software preinstalled.
* With restricted CPU and Memory resources, one is free to run any process on the containers.
* Users can keep track of their container status, and can stop, resume or remove them.

## Features:

* Provides multiple images for containers with different OS environments and software preinstalled, according to user needs.

* Provide a centralized server and database system to reduce the setup responsibilities of the users.

* Allow easy registration of new systems willing to host containers on their system.

## Applications:

* A centralized hosting solution for various projects in a campus, on one IP. This would enable multiple projects or sites to be hosted on a single IP without the hassle of setting up a database or a server on each container.
* A single powerful machine on the network can be used to run complex and resource heavy software and algorithms easily on isolated containers.
* Can act as a local storage and backup solution.
